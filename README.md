ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kelvin Chen! (^_^)

I am an aspiring software engineer that enjoys problem solving and cooperating with others to make processes more efficient. Currently, I graduated from Western Washington University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Chinese.

Throughout my computer science education so far, I've learned specific code algorithms (e.g. search and sorting ones), data structures, the importance runtime and space complexity, object-oriented code designs, cohesion and coupling, how the computer and operating systems work, threads and processes, and computer networks.

Also, a few of the hobbies I really enjoy are playing video games, watching anime, and dancing! (^_^) Recently, my favorite game to play is Genshin Impact, and the anime I'm currently watching are One Piece, Dr. Stone, and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable. At my university, I participated in a couple dance clubs: SINI-HHA (an all-inclusive Hip-Hop dance club) and High Intensity (a K-pop dance cover club, and I was the president of this club for the 2021-2022 school year).
